# Phone Market

Phone Market is a single-page website designed to simulate an online smartphone store. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, and SASS.

## Features

The website's front-end allows for easy browsing and purchasing of smartphones. The products are generated from a pre-existing array and are not connected to an actual back-end. The website includes the following features:

- Filtering: Users can filter the products by brand, price, and other attributes.
- Sorting: Users can sort the products by price, popularity, and rating.
- Search: Users can search for specific products by keyword.
- Cart: Users can add products to their cart, remove products, change quantities, and clear the entire cart. The cart uses localStorage to store the IDs of the selected products.
- Favorites: Users can select favorite products and view them separately, filtered and sorted in the same way as the main product list.
