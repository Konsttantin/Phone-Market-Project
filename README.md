## Features ⚙️

The website's front-end allows for easy browsing and purchasing of smartphones. The products are generated from a pre-existing array and are not connected to an actual back-end. The product samples are taken from [moyo.ua](https://www.moyo.ua/). The website includes the following features:

- 🗃️ Filtering: Users can filter the products by brand, price, and other attributes.
- 🔼/🔽 Sorting: Users can sort the products by price and rating.
- 🔎 Search: Users can search for specific products by keyword.
- 🛒 Cart: Users can add products to their cart, remove products, change quantities, and clear the entire cart. The cart uses localStorage to store the IDs of the selected products.
- ❤️ Favorites: Users can select favorite products and view them separately, filtered and sorted in the same way as the main product list.

The website is also fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, including mobile phones and tablets. On mobile devices, the search and filtering functionality is adapted for ease of use on touchscreens.
